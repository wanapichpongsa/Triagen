# SEE before_5pm branch for hackathon version

### Install dependencies

We're using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instead of pip because it uses Rust and its faster.

Go to `pyproject.toml` to find the library names for the following command:

```bash
uv add $dependency1 $dependency2 $dependency3
```
